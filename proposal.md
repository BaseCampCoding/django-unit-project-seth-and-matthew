# Quiz Game
## Matthew Wilson and Seth Hogue
## Description and Motivation
Our project will be an online trivia game similar to Trivia Crack, but less competitive. The project will include user profiles, question categories, a scoring system,
a leaderboard, and a badge system. Players will be given a random question within a certain category to try to answer. If correct, they earn points toward that
category. Each question that they answer in a row correctly will add to a streak multiplier. We wanted to make a project that will not only show off our Django skills but also be fun to use in the end. 
## Prior Art
The major inspiration for this project is Trivia Crack, an online quiz game where you directly compete against other players in a series of Trivia questions.
## Core User Workflows
New users are greeted with the options to Log in, Sign up, or play. If a user is logged in, they will be allowed to pick from various question categories or play with random questions from any category. They will then be prompted with a random question to answer. Once they submit their answer, they will be informed whether or not it was correct. If it was, they gain points and a bonus to their streak multiplier. If not, they don’t gain points and their streak is reset. After each question, they can either ask for another question or return to the landing page. On a separate leaderboard page, users with the most points will be listed. Users will also be allowed to go to other player’s profile pages, where they can see their overall score, score per category, and any special badges they have earned. On the side, there will be challenge quizzes, where users can attempt a series of questions they must get all correct for a large number of points and a unique badge.
## Daily Goals
### *Week 1*
### Tuesday
At the end of Tuesday, we want to have all the project models set up and migrated to a database (Matthew). We would also like to allow users to login, logout, and sign up (Seth).
### Wednesday
By the end of Wednesday, we want to create the landing page layout and prep for future content (Seth). Users are able to get questions from select/all categories. (Matthew)
### Thursday
We want to allow users to submit answers to a random question. We would also like to be able to tell users whether their answers were correct or not (Seth). We also want to keep track of users’ scores and have a leaderboard display (Matthew).
### Friday
We will make user profile pages, along with the badge system mentioned above (Matthew). We also want to make the landing page fully functional (Seth).
### *Week 2*
### Monday
We will first have a pair review over our current state with the project and decide whether we will continue on pace, cut back on the project, or add on to it. Afterwards, we will focus on expanding upon our question library (Seth). We will also add a badge page, where users can view all the badges available, and whether they own them or not (Matthew).
### Tuesday
We will add various badges for achieving certain question counts (Matthew). We will also work on the challenge system, where users will be presented with x questions, depending on which difficulty they choose (Easy, Medium, Hard),  that they must answer correctly in a row for a special prize (Seth).
### Wednesday
We will both focus on adding CSS styling to the site to make sure that the site is looking good and up to our standards. We will also spend today testing our site for bugs.

### Thursday
If we are finished with our site from a visual perspective and functionality perspective, we will then work on getting a messaging system between users set up (Seth). We want something on the navbar to notify users of unread messages and allow them to view them (Matthew).
